--- Version 0.6.6 ---
Updates and Fixes:
- As of 0.6.6, Realism mod is a REQUIREMENT. I have long anticipated this necessity, and the day has finally come. It was necessary to fix the bugs in my new reload system, and I imagine this change will bear much fruit.
- Fixed bugs related to the new Augmented Reload system.
- Added slider for Augmented Reload speed.

--- Version 0.6.5 ---
New Features:
- Added new Directional Sway feature for movement in different directions, your weapon has more complex movement when moving in all directions.
- Added new Augmented Reloads feature: when reloading or checking mag, if you press again your reload button, your character will look down at what he's doing and the animation speed will be increased by 30%.

Updates and Fixes:
- Huge repass on config entry names, things should be easier to read now.
- Fixed MP5k thinking he has a stock.
- Fixed extra freelook range to work even if not using the Deadzone feature.
- Default weapon cant value reduced to zero in recognition that Realism's new canting feature is better - and this mod is always meant to be played, let's say it together, with Realism maxed out very good.
